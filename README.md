This is a React JS app which was created for a coding test. It fetches Pokemon from an API and displays one every 500ms until they are all loaded. Clicking on a Pokemon "adds" it to your collection and displays it on the right including its stats. Clicking a Pokemon in your collection releases it back into the wild. 

I also implemented caching of all the images when they are fetched from the API but otherwise didn't need to add much more to it. I also tried to make it responsive. 

You can see a live demo of the app here: https://adriantache.github.io/poke-catcher/
